# Select-All-From-Hotkey
An autohotkey script that pastes "SELECT * FROM " into a text field. It also updates a counter saved in a txt document by 1 with every paste, just for fun.

By default the hotkey is CTRL+5 (1-4 are used by me as shortcuts in SSMS).

Only configuration is setting up the file path for counter.
